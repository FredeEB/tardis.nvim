Tardis allows you to travel in time (git history) scrolling through each
revision of your current file.

Inspired by
`git-timemachine <https://github.com/emacsmirror/git-timemachine>`__
which I used extensively when I was using emacs.

Installation
============

Like with any other

.. code:: lua

   {
       'fredeeb/tardis.nvim',
       dependencies = { 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' },
       config = true,
   }

The default options are

.. code:: lua

    require('tardis-nvim').setup {
        keymap = {
            ["next"] = '<C-j>',             -- next entry in log (older)
            ["prev"] = '<C-k>',             -- previous entry in log (newer)
            ["quit"] = 'q',                 -- quit all
            ["revision_message"] = '<C-m>', -- show revision message for current revision
        },
        initial_revisions = 10,             -- initial revisions to create buffers for
        max_revisions = 256,                -- max number of revisions to load
    }

Usage
=====

Using tardis is pretty simple

::

   :Tardis

This puts you into a new buffer where you can use the keymaps, like
described above, to navigate the revisions of the currently open file
